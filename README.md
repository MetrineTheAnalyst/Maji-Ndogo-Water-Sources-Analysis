# Maji-Ndogo-Water-Sources-Analysis
Project purpose
The purpose of this project is to gather insights about water sources in Maji Ndogo based on available datasets.
The analysis answers practical questions about source distribution, population served, contamination, and suggested improvements. 
SQL scripts join tables (location, visits, water_source, well_pollution), aggregate results, build pivot tables, and populate a Project_progress table for field work tracking.
